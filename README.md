Cansina
=======

Cansina is a (yet another) Web Content Discovery Application.

It takes general available dictionaries of common path and files used by web applications
and make URL requests looking back to the server response code.

It tries to be simple and directed to use doing only one thing: Discover content.

The app is far from being finished, probably is poorly coded and I wouldn't recommend it
to use in a serious pentesting session. If you are looking for a true tool take a look at
[wfuzz](http://www.edge-security.com/wfuzz.php)

Feature requests and comments are welcome.
